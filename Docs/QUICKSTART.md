# Quickstart Guide
## How to install PeanutScript
____
To run PeanutScript you need 2 files:
- peanut.py
- shell.py <br>

**MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER.** <br>
*Consider simply using the "Dist" folder.*<br><br>
You can download this folder directly from this Github!<br><br>

Note: **Make sure you have Python 3 installed!**

## Running a Script
___
If you did as this guide suggested and simply downloaded the "Dist" folder you will already have your first PeanutScript file!<br>
This file is called `example.peanut` and contains a simple for loop and a function called "gwa". This function takes in a string input and gives an output based on that string! Feel free to try it out.<br><br>
Note: **This part of the guide is assuming you use Windows 10.**<br>
I have no other OSs available to test this on :( <br>
If you successfully ran a PeanutScript file on another OS please let me know how you did it, and I will add it to this part of the guide!<br><br>
Okay, now it's time to start PeanutScript!
- Simply open a cmd window. This window does not need admin permissions.
- Use `cd` to move into the file with your PeanutScript files.
- `python peanutShell.py`
- Congrats! You've successfully started PeanutScript! <br><br>

To run your script file simply use `run("example")`!<br>
You do not need to add .peanut to the end of the file name when using `run`, PeanutScript does this for you :)

## Concluding Words
____
Congrats on successfully running and installing PeanutScript!<br>
If you'd like to make your own files you can simply create a new file called whatever you like, just don't forget to add `.peanut` as the file extension!<br>
